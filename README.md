# World-Tooltips "who doesn't like shaders" edition

**World-Tooltips is a mod for Minecraft that adds tooltips over items on the ground making it easier to see what's on the ground.**

# *Differences from the [original version](https://github.com/GenuineSounds/World-Tooltips/tree/1.7.10):*
### 1) Updated build script, thanks to GTNH!
### 2) Fixed rendering with shaders, no more flickering


# TODO:
